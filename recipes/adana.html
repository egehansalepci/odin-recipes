        <p>The most famous come from Adana, the fifth-largest city in Turkey, and they're quite strict about what constitutes a *real* Adana kebab. Like many protected regional dishes, the definitions are designed around a No True Scotsman-style rhetoric (think: hand-chopped lamb meat and fat from the tail of a spring lamb that has grazed on nothing but budding sumac blossoms, aged in sunlight for no more than 13 hours and no fewer than 12, seasoned with dried roasted chiles and the sweat of a bearded Turkish butcher) making it all but impossible to recreate a true Adana kebab anywhere outside of Adana. But that's okay. A good imposter still tastes just as good.</p>
        <p>The grilled meat is typically served as a platter with rice and salad, or inside a tightly rolled wrap made with Turkish lavash, along with a red onion and parsley salad seasoned with sumac. Before rolling up the bread, the grilled meat is sprinkled with a mixture of cumin, sumac, salt, and roasted chiles. It all gets washed down with ayran, a salty yogurt-based drink.</p>
